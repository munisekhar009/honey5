          <p>While losing weight is difficult for many people, it is even more challenging to keep the weight off. Most people who lose a large amount of weight have regained it 2 to 3 years later. One theory about regaining lost weight is that people who decrease the amount of calories they consume to lose weight experience a drop in the rate their bodies burn calories. This makes it increasingly difficult to lose weight over a period of months. A lower rate of burning calories may also make it easier to regain weight after a more normal diet is resumed. For these reasons, extremely low calorie diets and rapid weight loss are discouraged.</p>
          <p>Losing no more than 1/2 to 2 Kilos per week is recommended. Incorporating long-term lifestyle changes are needed to increase the chance of successful long-term weight loss.</p>
          <p>Weight loss to a healthy weight for a person's height can promote health benefits. These include lower cholesterol and blood sugar levels, lower blood pressure, less stress on bones and joints, and less work for the heart. It is vital to maintain weight loss to obtain health benefits over a lifetime.</p>
          <p>Keeping extra weight off takes effort and commitment, just as losing weight does. Weight loss goals are reached by a combination of changes in diet, eating habits, and exercise. In extreme circumstances, people turn to bariatric surgery. <a class="btn btn-outline-success float-end" href="book.html">Book Appointment</a></p>

          <p>Humans have engaged with the concept of beauty for millennia, trying to define it while being defined by it.</p>
          <p>Plato thought that merely contemplating beauty caused “the soul to grow wings.” Ralph Waldo Emerson found beauty in Raphael’s “The Transfiguration,” writing that “a calm benignant beauty shines over all this picture, and goes directly to the heart.” In “My Skin,” Lizzo sings: “The most beautiful thing that you ever seen is even bigger than what we think it means.”</p>
          <p>We asked a group of artists, scientists, writers and thinkers to answer this simple question: Why is beauty, however defined, so important in our lives? Here are their responses.</p>
          <p>Suddenly, we are marveled and uplifted, pulled out of our small, ordinary lives and taken to a realm far richer and more eloquent than anything we know. Call it enchantment, the difference between the time-bound and the timeless, between us and the otherworldly. All beauty and art evoke harmonies that transport us to a place where, for only seconds, time stops and we are one with the world. It is the best life has to offer. <a class="btn btn-outline-success float-end" href="book.html">Book Appointment</a></p>

          <p>It protects you against many chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes and cancer. Eating a variety of foods and consuming less salt, sugars and saturated and industrially-produced trans-fats, are essential for healthy diet.</p>
          <p>A healthy diet comprises a combination of different foods. These include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Staples like cereals (wheat, barley, rye, maize or rice) or starchy tubers or roots (potato, yam, taro or cassava).</li>
            <li>Legumes (lentils and beans).</li>
            <li>Fruit and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Foods from animal sources (meat, fish, eggs and milk).</li>

          <p>Here is some useful information, based on WHO recommendations, to follow a healthy diet, and the benefits of doing so.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit</li>
            <li>Eat less fat</li>
